If you like my plugin, feel free to give a star to the GitHub repository or send a WeChat appreciation. This will motivate me to continue improving this plugin and developing new ones.

Maintaining plugins is time-consuming and labor-intensive. My personal time and energy are limited. Open source is about sharing; it doesn't mean I have to spend my time freely implementing features that users request.

I will gradually improve the features I need (appreciations can help prioritize updates). For features I consider improvable but not immediately necessary, I will implement them only after receiving a specified amount of appreciation (marked with a donation label and required amount). For features I don't need or that are too complex to implement, I will close the issue directly and not consider implementation.

Friends who have accumulated appreciations of 50 RMB and wish to add me on WeChat can send an email to <span data-type="a" data-href="mailto:achuan-2@outlook.com">achuan-2@outlook.com</span> to request adding as a friend (I will not reply to emails or add friends from those whose total appreciation is less than 50 RMB, as I do not wish to serve as a free support service).
